This project involves analyzing online order data using SQL for extraction and Python for analysis and visualization to uncover insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and operational efficiency. By extracting data from a relational database and cleaning it with Python, the project aims to perform statistical analysis, identify top-performing products, sales trends, and customer segments, and evaluate order processing and shipping efficiency. The findings will be presented through visualizations and a comprehensive report, supporting data-driven decision-making in e-commerce. Technologies used include SQL, Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly), and Jupyter Notebook.
